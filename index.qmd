Hello! My name is Elizabeth McDaniel and I am a Scientist passionate about microbes, bioinformatics, and open science.

I'm currently a Scientist at the [Astera Institute](https://astera.org/) working on a project at the intersection of fermented foods and human health, where we are exploring ways of getting the health benefits of fermented foods to people in an accessible way and producing public datasets to spur innovative research in this area.

Previously I was a scientist at [Arcadia Science](https://www.arcadiascience.com/), where I created computational tools and approaches towards understanding diverse organisms across the tree of life, and contributed to pubs released through a non-journal based publishing platform.

I received my PhD in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](https://microbiology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. Prior to moving to industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.

You can find more information about [my work](work.qmd), what I'm [writing about](writing.qmd), and how to get [in contact](contact.qmd) with me!
