Hello! My name is Elizabeth McDaniel and I am a Scientist passionate about microbes, bioinformatics, resource recovery technologies, and open science.

I was previously a computational scientist at [Arcadia Science](arcadia.science), where I worked on a variety of projects towards understanding diverse organisms across the tree of life. I created computational workflows and approaches for pilot projects and productionized tools, and contributed to pubs released on a custom non-journal-based publishing platform.

I received my PhD in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](https://microbiology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with [Dr. Katherine McMahon](https://mcmahonlab.wisc.edu/) studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. I earned my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville and was an undergraduate research assistant in [Dr. Jeffrey Lewis' Lab](https://www.thelewislab.com/) studying natural variation of stress responses in yeast.

Prior to moving to industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia with [Dr. Ryan Ziels](https://www.zielslab.com/) and [Dr. Steven Hallam](https://hallam.microbiology.ubc.ca/) in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.

You can find more information about current projects I'm working on and prior academic publications on the [Publications & Projects](publications.qmd) page and my [contact information](contact.qmd).
