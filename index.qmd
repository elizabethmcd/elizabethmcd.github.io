Hello! My name is Elizabeth McDaniel and I am a Scientist at [Arcadia Science](arcadia.science) creating computational workflows and resources for fueling scientific discoveries. I am passionate about reproducible and open research practices, as well as helping other researchers with their analytical challenges.

I received my PhD in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](https://microbiology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with [Dr. Katherine McMahon](https://mcmahonlab.wisc.edu/) studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. I earned my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville and was an undergraduate research assistant in [Dr. Jeffrey Lewis' Lab](https://www.thelewislab.com/) studying natural variation of stress responses in yeast.

Prior to my position at Arcadia Science, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia with [Dr. Ryan Ziels](https://www.zielslab.com/) and [Dr. Steven Hallam](https://hallam.microbiology.ubc.ca/) in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.

You can find more information about current projects I'm working on and prior academic publications on the [Publications & Projects](publications.qmd) page and my [contact information](contact.qmd).
