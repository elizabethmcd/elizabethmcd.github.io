The best way to contact me is at the email address above.

**I no longer accept requests to review for peer-reviewed journals with closed review practices.** However, I do enjoy reviewing preprints and posting public comments. If you have a preprint that you think I might be interested in reviewing, please email me with the preprint link. My expertise spans environmental microbiology, with specific emphasis on microbial ecology of engineered water systems and multi-omics approaches.

During my PhD and postdoc, I was incredibly dedicated to practicing reproducible and open research by publicly providing associated code and datasets with each of my publications. For each manuscript on my [Publications](https://elizabethmcd.github.io/publications/) page, I have provided a PDF copy for download, links to code workflows available on Github, datasets on Figshare, and/or genomes/meta-omics datasets available on NCBI. Should you have any problems downloading a manuscript that may be behind a paywall for you, or have any questions about my code/datasets, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address above.
