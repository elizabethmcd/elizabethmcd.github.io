    "text": "Hello! My name is Elizabeth McDaniel and I am a Scientist passionate about microbes, bioinformatics, and open science.\nI’m currently a Scientist at the Astera Institute working on a project at the intersection of fermented foods and human health, where we are exploring how to deliver the health benefits of fermented foods to people and producing public datasets for the community.\nPreviously I was a computational scientist at Arcadia Science, where I created computational tools and approaches towards understanding diverse organisms across the tree of life, and contributed to pubs released through a non-journal based publishing platform. Prior to moving to industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.\nI received my PhD in the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. I earned my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville and did undergraduate research on the natural variation of stress responses in yeast.\nYou can find more information about my work, what I’m writing about, and how to get in contact with me!"

    "text": "From time-to-time life scientists entering the industry job market after finishing their PhD/postdoc will ask me for advice on how to best position themselves for making this transition. In general, I think advice is super subjective and people oftentimes leave out how much luck or circumstances 1 at the time played a part in how they ended up where they are now. However, there are some general things I’ve learned since making this transition almost three years ago 2 and have since found myself repeatedly telling others these little tips. Therefore, I’m motivated to write these learnings out in the hopes they are helpful to others on the job market and a more high-throughput way of reaching people than 1:1 conversation."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nMy personal circumstances when I was a postdoc looking for industry jobs: I started my PhD in Microbiology in fall of 2016 and finished in summer of 2021. I did a short ~10 month postdoc and started looking for industry jobs in spring of 2022. My background is microbial metagenomics/multi-’omics, and I have some amount of wet-lab experience. Since fall of 2022 I’ve worked in industry settings in the San Francisco Bay Area, albeit not those super typical of traditional biotech. If I remember correctly, I applied to 5 jobs in industry – 2 never responded, 1 responded 5 months later (after I had a job offer), I had 1 informational interview before the company had a hiring freeze, and I had 1 full set of interviews that led to a job offer. All the jobs I applied to were computational biology/bioinformatics scientist roles with a metagenomics/microbial focus and I was looking to be on-site full-time with whatever job offer I ended up with, as it was just me and my cat and I wasn’t specifically constrained on geographic location.↩︎\nI have no idea if any of these learnings actually help with finding a job, especially in the current job market environment. Since I’ve only worked in two non-traditional companies that are sort of like early-stage startups, I also don’t know if these learnings are useful to applying to larger companies or in the government sector. I’ve seen some of these things recommended by other people, but YMMV.↩︎"

However, I do enjoy reviewing preprints and posting public comments. If you have a preprint that you think I might be interested in reviewing, please email me with the preprint link. My expertise spans environmental microbiology, with specific emphasis on microbial ecology of engineered water systems and multi-omics approaches.\nDuring my PhD and postdoc, I was incredibly dedicated to practicing reproducible and open research by publicly providing associated code and datasets with each of my publications. For each manuscript on my Publications page, I have provided a PDF copy for download, links to code workflows available on Github, datasets on Figshare, and/or genomes/meta-omics datasets available on NCBI. Should you have any problems downloading a manuscript that may be behind a paywall for you, or have any questions about my code/datasets, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address above."
