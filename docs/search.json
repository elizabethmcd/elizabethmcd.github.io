    "text": "From time-to-time life scientists entering the industry job market after finishing their PhD/postdoc will ask me for advice on how to best position themselves for making this transition. In general, I think advice is super subjective and people oftentimes leave out how much luck or circumstances 1 at the time played a part in how they ended up where they are now. However, there are some general things I’ve learned since making this transition almost three years ago 2 and have since found myself repeatedly telling others these little tips. Therefore, I’m motivated to write these learnings out in the hopes they are helpful to others on the job market and a more high-throughput way of reaching people than 1:1 conversation."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nMy personal circumstances when I was a postdoc looking for industry jobs: I started my PhD in Microbiology in fall of 2016 and finished in summer of 2021. I did a short ~10 month postdoc and started looking for industry jobs in spring of 2022. My background is microbial metagenomics/multi-’omics, and I have some amount of wet-lab experience. Since fall of 2022 I’ve worked in industry settings in the San Francisco Bay Area, albeit not those super typical of traditional biotech. If I remember correctly, I applied to 5 jobs in industry – 2 never responded, 1 responded 5 months later (after I had a job offer), I had 1 informational interview before the company had a hiring freeze, and I had 1 full set of interviews that led to a job offer. All the jobs I applied to were computational biology/bioinformatics scientist roles with a metagenomics/microbial focus and I was looking to be on-site full-time with whatever job offer I ended up with, as it was just me and my cat and I wasn’t specifically constrained on geographic location.↩︎\nI have no idea if any of these learnings actually help with finding a job, especially in the current job market environment. Since I’ve only worked in two non-traditional companies that are sort of like early-stage startups, I also don’t know if these learnings are useful to applying to larger companies or in the government sector. I’ve seen some of these things recommended by other people, but YMMV.↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are basically only two topics that I feel I can give generally actionable “advice” on. One is how to make the transition from academia to industry. The other is going to grad school and getting a PhD in the life sciences. I feel inclined to write about my thoughts on getting a PhD in the life sciences for the same reason that I wrote my transitioning to industry post – 1) There are some things that I’ve found myself repeating a lot over the years, and writing them down might help reach more people, and 2) This is another area where people don’t acknowledge enough how luck is a huge factor in where they ended up, and I think that’s super important context to remember when making your own decisions.\nI particularly remember a time where a friend asked advice about going to grad school and said they thought the way I approached my scientific training was the right way. To which I immediately laughed and made it very clear that I didn’t intentionally plan the vast majority of what happened 1. Most of my decisions were fueled by what I was most interested in at the time, and I chose environments that I thought could best foster those interests. And those environments led to new things to be curious and learn about, which led to new people, which led to new environments and so and so forth.\nThe below advice doesn’t really cover applying to graduate school. It’s been ~10 years since I did that myself, and so much has changed about that process since I went through it, I don’t think I could give useful advice 2."

    "section": "Footnotes",
    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nSimilar to my industry post, I’ve written out a brief summary of my personal circumstances and path through science as a footnote. Although I think most advice posts would have the below stories woven into the advice parts, I think it’s mostly distracting from the main points. But I still want to demonstrate how just being curious or lucky at pivotal points really have more to do with where I am now than some grand plan.\n\nI entered college in 2012 wanting to be a medical doctor, because I didn’t know what else you could do if you loved science. This desire started to fade in the middle of my freshman year when 1) I realized I probably couldn’t deal with human bodily fluids and functions, 2) I started to meet scientific researchers that got a PhD, and 3) I started my own research experience. The honors program I was in required at least 2 years of research, but since in the middle of freshman year I wasn’t totally sold on wanting to be a medical doctor, I started scrolling through the list of professors in the biology department that might have research openings for undergrads. I remember around that time I was fascinated in general about pathogen evolution and maybe wanted to research that. The lab I ended up joining did work on microbial evolution, but not specifically on pathogens. But it was the best environment and set of mentors I could have asked for where I was able to be curious, learn how to design experiments, keep trying after an experiment went wrong, and develop my writing skills. I originally was a Spanish minor (because I thought it would pair well with going to medical school) but wasn’t enjoying it. I switched to minoring in Statistics, and in my senior year took some programming classes both through my stats coursework and a programming for biology course. This is where the pieces started to come together that I really enjoyed computational biology and wanted to do more analytical work paired with microbial evolution.\n\nI applied to 6 graduate programs – two different programs at University of Washington, two different programs at University of Wisconsin – Madison, a large umbrella program at University of North Carolina, and Emory University. The unifying theme of where I applied was that I wanted a large-ish program that I could rotate through labs, because I really didn’t know what I wanted to do. And I had basically also been given the advice that rotating through labs is a good idea to make sure you are a good fit with the lab, mentor, etc. I knew broadly I was interested in microbial evolution and further developing my computational skills, but beyond that I didn’t know any specifics, not even what types of careers I would want after graduate school. I ended up going on three interviews and entered the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program at UW-Madison in fall of 2016.\n\nMDTP required a minimum of three rotations, and I ended up doing four because at the end of my three rotations I hadn’t found the right fit. At the time, the perfectionist, high-achieving parts of me saw this as a colossal failure, because I was the only one in my cohort that hadn’t joined a lab. But I talked to other students in my program that had previously done multiple rotations, and the common sentiment was they were actually happier with their choice because they had really taken the time to make sure they found the right fit rather than just forcing a decision to fit in. And this was exactly the case for me. The lab I ended up joining was probably the furthest from my radar, and I had actually crossed it off the list because I didn’t do “ecology or engineering” which were elements of what the lab did. But they were working on really interesting microbial evolution problems using computational tools, and I really felt I could fit well with the PI and the lab culture. Now I love thinking about applied biotechnology and microbiology problems. And the rest is history.↩︎\nContext for when I applied to grad school in 2015 – the GRE was still required, being an author on a publication wasn’t an “unwritten requirement,” and I didn’t have my own independent funding that I had been awarded. I had ~2 full years of research experience at the time of applying, primarily at my undergrad institution but also one summer internship experience. Nowadays a lot has changed that I don’t even know what to recommend to prospective grad students other than to have research experience of some sort so they have an idea of if they even enjoy that sort of work. Everything else involving the GRE (or not), grades, research experience, publications, funding, recommendation letters, etc. I’ve been too far removed from to be helpful.↩︎"
