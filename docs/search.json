    "text": "The best way to contact me is at the email address above. Arcadia Science is reimagining scientific publishing and does not publish our work in traditional peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, I do not accept requests to review for peer-reviewed journals. However, Arcadia Science regularly engages in reviewing preprints and posting public comments. You can view the public comments I’ve made on preprints through Hypothesis. If you have a preprint that you think I might be interested in reviewing, please email me with the preprint link and I will do my best to review it and post a public comment. My expertise spans environmental microbiology and computational biology, with specific emphasis on microbial ecology of engineered water systems and multi-omics approaches.\nDuring my PhD and postdoc, I was incredibly dedicated to practicing reproducible and open research by publicly providing associated code and datasets with each of my publications. For each manuscript on my Publications page, I have provided a PDF copy for download, links to code workflows available on Github, datasets on Figshare, and/or genomes/meta-omics datasets available on NCBI. Should you have any problems downloading a manuscript that may be behind a paywall for you, or have any questions about my code/datasets, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address above."

    "text": "I received my PhD in the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Dr. Katherine McMahon studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. I earned my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville and was an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Jeffrey Lewis’ Lab studying natural variation of stress responses in yeast.\nPrior to my position at Arcadia Science, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia with Dr. Ryan Ziels and Dr. Steven Hallam in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.\nYou can find more information about current projects I’m working on and prior academic publications on the Publications & Projects page and my contact information."
